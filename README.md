# 97 Percent
This is an application that I am developing as my final project for Launch Code's 'LC-101' program.  I decided to take the 'front-end development track' and this project showcases what I have learned in this program.

### What is it?
While researching this project, I came across the fact that 97% of members of the House of Representatives that were up for re-election in 2016 actually did, once again, get elected.  As a result of this, I decided to develop an application that would make it very easy for a user to find basic information about their representative.

### As a user I can find my representative's
* name
* party
* voting record percentage w/party
* phone number
* next election date
* office address
* web address

### Technologies Used
* Javascript
* JQuery
* Who's My Representative API
* ProPublica API
* Bootstrap
* HTML5/CSS
